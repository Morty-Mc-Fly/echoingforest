# **Game Design Document: Savehouse**

---

## **High Concept**

A psychological horror survival game where players are trapped in a mysterious forest that resets their location if they stray too far. Starting in a house on a clearing, the only safe zone, players must venture out to gather resources and craft tools while avoiding dangers that lurk in the dark. Narrow, hidden paths offer the only way to progress deeper into the forest, but nightfall brings horrifying threats that test their sanity and survival.

## **Core Gameplay Loop**

1. **Start in the Safe House:**
   - The house serves as the only safe zone where players can craft, rest, and plan.
2. **Day Exploration:**
   - Players venture into the forest to gather materials, relying on light and memory to find their way.
3. **Sanity Mechanic:**
   - Darkness and nighttime reduce sanity, leading to visual distortions and hallucinations.
4. **Night Survival:**
   - Players either retreat to the house or face the forest's "other things" that come alive at night.
5. **Progression:**
   - Craft totems and tools to explore further, unlocking hidden paths and expanding the safe zone.

## **Gameplay Features**

### **1. Safe House**

- A central hub where players are completely safe from harm.
- Players can:
  - **Craft Items:** Create totems, light sources, and other tools.
  - **Store Resources:** Keep gathered materials for future use.
  - **Regain Sanity:** Rest and recover from the psychological effects of the forest.

### **2. Forest Exploration**

- **Looping Forest:** Moving too far in one direction causes the player to reappear in a familiar part of the forest.
- **Hidden Paths:** Narrow, hard-to-detect paths allow progression to new areas.
- **Resource Gathering:** Players collect wood, stone, herbs, and other materials to craft tools and survive.

### **3. Sanity Mechanic**

- **Sanity Loss:**
  - Occurs in dark areas or when venturing out at night.
  - Results in:
    - Blurry vision.
    - Hallucinations (e.g., fake paths, false threats).
    - Slower movement or distorted sounds.
- **Sanity Restoration:**
  - Return to the house.
  - Use crafted items like charms or light sources.

### **4. Nighttime Threats**

- **The “Other Things”:** Mysterious entities roam the forest at night.
  - Some are passive unless provoked, while others actively hunt the player.
- **Light Sources:** Torches and lanterns can repel weaker threats but might attract stronger ones.

### **5. Crafting**

- **Totems:** Indicate safe zones or paths that won’t reset.
- **Light Sources:** Torches, lanterns, or fire pits to illuminate areas.
- **Defensive Tools:** Traps or noise-makers to distract or deter threats.
- **Sanity Restoratives:** Herbal brews or charms to regain sanity.

## **Progression**

### **1. Unlocking the Forest**

- **Hidden Clues:** Environmental hints guide players to true paths, such as:
  - Unique tree formations.
  - Subtle light patterns or sounds.
- **Totem Crafting:** Place totems at key locations to stabilize areas and expand exploration.

### **2. Upgrading the Safe House**

- Players can improve the house by gathering resources to:
  - Build crafting stations.
  - Increase storage capacity.
  - Add light sources for better sanity recovery.

### **3. Narrative Progression**

- Uncover lore about the forest through:
  - Scattered notes or artifacts.
  - Interactions with ancient ruins or strange symbols.
- The forest’s mystery ties to the player's backstory and the purpose of the totems.

## **Core Mechanics**

### **1. Movement and Exploration**

- Free movement through the forest with no fixed paths visible on the map.
- Paths reset unless true paths are discovered.

### **2. Sanity and Light**

- **Sanity Drops:** When in darkness or during prolonged nighttime exploration.
- **Light Management:** Torches and lanterns consume resources and attract attention.

### **3. Crafting and Resources**

- Gather resources like:
  - Wood and stone: Basic tools and torches.
  - Herbs: Sanity-restoring brews.
  - Rare items: Found deeper in the forest for advanced crafting.
